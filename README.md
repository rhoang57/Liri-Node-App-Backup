# Liri-Node-App
Liri is a one-stop command line node app that takes in parameters for songs, bands, and movies and returns relevant data.

This app makes calls to the Spotify API, BandsInTown API, and OMDB API for search results.

When running this app in your command line, you may use the following to find your desired data:
'spotify-this-song', 'concert-this', 'movie-this', and 'do-what-it-says'.

***NOTE: If you would like to clone this repo, you will have to include your own .env file with your own unique Spotify ID and Secret. The format of your .env should look like below. Make sure to use your unique Spotify ID and Spotify Secret directly following the "=" below with no extra spaces.
